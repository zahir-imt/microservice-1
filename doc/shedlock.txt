ShedLock is a lightweight Java library that ensures scheduled tasks run only once across multiple instances of a Spring Boot application in a distributed environment.
It solves the problem of duplicate task execution (e.g., sending duplicate emails or running conflicting cleanup jobs) that occurs when using
Spring's standard @Scheduled annotation with multiple running instances.

How ShedLock Works
==================
ShedLock uses a shared external storage mechanism (like a database, Redis, or MongoDB) to manage locks.

    Lock Acquisition: Before a scheduled task runs, all instances try to acquire a lock in the shared storage.
    Execution: Only the instance that successfully acquires the lock is allowed to execute the task.
    Skipping: Other instances see the lock is held and skip their execution attempt.
    Lock Release: Once the task is complete, or after a specified timeout (lockAtMostFor), the lock is released, making it available for the next scheduled execution by any
                instance

Implementation Steps (using a database)
Implementing ShedLock involves these steps:

    Add Dependencies: Add shedlock-spring, shedlock-provider-jdbc-template, and JDBC support to your project (see Maven Repository for latest versions).
    Create a Lock Table: Create a table in your shared database for lock management.
    Configure ShedLock: Enable scheduling and ShedLock (@EnableScheduling, @EnableSchedulerLock) and define a JdbcTemplateLockProvider bean.
    Annotate Tasks: Use @SchedulerLock(name = "UniqueName", lockAtMostFor = "...", lockAtLeastFor = "...") alongside @Scheduled
